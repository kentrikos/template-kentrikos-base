# For the deployments IAM policies and IAM roles need to be created. In most of
# the AWS environment we've seen you are able to work with IAM roles, but often
# you can't create IAM policies by your own.
#
# With this setting you can control if IAM policies will be created by
# terraform (true) or if the IAM Policies already exists in your account.
# If this parameter is true, terraform will create the IAM policies for
# Kubernetes. Example:
# auto_IAM_mode = true

auto_IAM_mode = false

# IAM path for all policies automatically created by this terraform deployment.
# IAM path must start and end with "/". Examples:
# auto_IAM_path = "/"
#   or
# auto_IAM_path = "/path/for/my/policy/"

# Deprecated and customer specific - do not use/modify!
# List of resources (=arns) that will be added as NotResource for IAM log
# policy. If set, police will use for NotResource, for example:
#
# logs_not_resource = ["arn:aws:logs:eu-central-1:123456789012:myloggroup"]
#
# This will result in the following IAM policy:
#
# {
#    "Version":"2012-10-17",
#    "Statement":[
#        {
#            "Sid":"AllowLogModifications",
#            "Effect":"Allow",

#                "arn:aws:logs:eu-central-1:123456789012:myloggroup"
#            ]
#        }
#    ]
# }
#
# If the value is empty, the policy will allow actions for all Resources, for
# example:
#
# logs_not_resource = []
#
# This will result in the following IAM policy:
#
# {
#    "Version":"2012-10-17",
